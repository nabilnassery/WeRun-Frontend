# WeRun #


### Mission Statement ###

Welcome to WeRun, a site where runners of all ability levels can connect with other runners in their community. Join a local training run with runners in your area!


### How to Join a Run ###

Register a profile on WeRun including a username, email address, and profile picture. Login with credentials and post a run to the Runs page. Enter your pace/hr, length of the intended run, and an address for the run starting point.

From the available list, runners in your community can browse and express their interest (coming soon!) in joining for a run.


### Technologies Used ###

 * React 
 * Express
 * NodeJS
 * MongoDB
 * Mongoose
 * JSX

### Existing Features ###

Users can register on the site and upon logging in, create a run indicating the pace, duration, and location of the run. A field to enter picture is also provided (but will be disabled in the future in lieu of a profile picture).

Editing all fields of a posted run is allowable only by the user, as well as deletion of the post.
